# Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-discovery-of-handwashing
Reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing.


In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

Here I have reanalyzed the medical data Semmelweis collected and got an actual vizualisation on the impact handwashing had on preventing and reducing deaths.
